Spans
^^^^^
Spans are used to send data representing a time frame. Span types must contain StartTime and EndTime timestamp attributes. Optional descriptive attributes may accompany these attributes.

On-premises PI systems interpret Span objects as Event Frames.

Span data is not presently supported in Qi.
