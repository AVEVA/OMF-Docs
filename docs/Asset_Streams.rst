Asset Streams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Asset streams represent metadata describing the device(s) being observed and should be used to capture data that is descriptive and relatively static in nature.

In an on-premises PI system, data elements in an asset stream are mapped to AF elements, where the element name is taken from the elementâ€™s index property.

With cloud-hosted Qi systems, asset streams are mapped to Qi streams.
