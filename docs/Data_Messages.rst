Data Messages
-------------

Once usable types and streams have been created, data messages can be posted to a stream. Data messages can span multiple streams. The body of a data message is comprised of an array of key-value pairs, where the key is the stream ID, and the value is an array of data objects conforming to the given stream's type definition.
