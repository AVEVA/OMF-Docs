Data Messages
-------------

Once usable Types and Streams have been created, Data messages can be posted to a Stream. Data messages can span multiple Streams. The body of a Data message is comprised of an array of key-value pairs, where the key is the Stream ID, and the value is an array of Data objects conforming to the given Stream's Type definition.
