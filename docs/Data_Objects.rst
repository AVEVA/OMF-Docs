Data Objects
------------
Data Objects conform to a pre-defined Value, Asset, Span, or Link type and are associated with a pre-defined stream. On-premises systems translate Value objects to time-series PI events, Asset objects to AF elements, and Span objects to Event Frames. Link objects generate relationships between AF elements, PI data references, and Event Frames.

Cloud-hosted Qi systems translate all objects to Qi events.
