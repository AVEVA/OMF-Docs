Streams
-------

A stream is defined as a sequence of data objects of identical type, where each object has a unique, definable index. Each stream has a unique ID, defined upon creation of the stream. OMF defines four distinct stream types, which influence how the stream's data objects are mapped to structures in the target system.

If the type is not supplied when the stream is created, the stream is assumed to be a value stream.
