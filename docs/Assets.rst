Assets
^^^^^^
Assets represent metadata describing the device(s) being observed and should be used to capture data that is descriptive and relatively static in nature.

In an on-premises PI system, Asset objects are mapped to AF elements.

The cloud-hosted Qi system maps asset streams to Qi streams.
