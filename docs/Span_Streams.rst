Span Streams
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Span streams are used to send data representing a time frame. Span stream types must contain StartTime and EndTime timestamp attributes. Optional descriptive attributes may accompany these three required attributes.

On-premises PI systems interpret Span stream data objects as Event Frames.

Span data is not presently supported in Qi.
